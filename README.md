# Library APP
Imagine building a library management system for a school. 
This system will allow users to search for books, borrow available books, and return them when finished. 
To achieve this, we will utilize object-oriented programming concepts such as classes, objects, encapsulation, and inheritance in Java.

Project Description:
The aim of this project is to develop a library management system in Java that enables users to search for books by title or author, 
borrow available books, and return them once read. The system will also empower administrators to add new books to the catalog and manage book loans.
For this project we have worked together: Miguel Iv√°n Angel, Juan Antonio Molina, Miguel Angel Gonzalez e Isamar Romero
